    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ligands are ions or molecules that donate electrons to a central functional group to form a coordination complex. This notebook focuses on the different kinds of PDB searches surrounding ligands. While these searches are limited to interests relating to ligands, by combining them with other search queries, you can find highly specific outputs and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook, there are a few kind of ligand searches that it is aiming to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Free Versus Polymeric Ligands\n",
    "+ Ligands of Interest\n",
    "+ Ligand Binding Affinity\n",
    "+ Structure-Ligand Complexes\n",
    " \n",
    "With each of these query types, there are some different parameters which help you create the search you are interested in. Many of the searches would allow for you to search for practically everything but the code comments will provide a more clear indication of whether you can input any value or what the parameters of the value actually are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has a variety of input variables and each of these will be explained in the step of the notebook they are relevant to. The output of this notebook will be a list of all possible PDB files that fill your search parameters, and then these can be further explored using libraries such as pandas to create data frames and analyze this data.\n",

    "1. Step 1 - Installing libraries and importing them into the notebook\n",
