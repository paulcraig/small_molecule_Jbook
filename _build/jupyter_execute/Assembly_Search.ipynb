    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCSB PDB is the repository for all publicly available experimentally determined protein structures in the world. This notebook is made in order to demonstrate and elaborate on how to use the rcsbsearchapi Python library to recreate Advanced Searches from the RCSB PDB in Python. Further, this notebook will show how to download the files of the results of these searches, also in Python. This will be done through searching particularly for different assemblies represented in the RCSB PDB, with each search demonstrating a different way of utilizing the Advanced Search tool."

    "The search is tested for functionality by analyzing the first 10 results of the search in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b) Validation By File Request\n",
    "\n",
    "The search is tested for functionality by requesting the file of the first search result. This is the step where the results will be changed if needed for the sake of requesting and downloading their corresponding file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2c) Validation By File Download\n",
    "\n",
    "The search is tested for functionality by downloading and reading the contents of the first search result's file. This includes the generation of a folder for the files of the search result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Complete Search Download\n",
    "\n",
    "Following validation, each file in the search result is downloaded into the previously generated file."
